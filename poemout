Alas! How is she now fortified
Alien meanings. And in them he
All, all, that words can yet control,
All recommend him to the doctors
All that Onegin knew of her.
Already, and it is as you conjecture.
Although in general he saw no sense
Although in the past some madrigals
Although meanwhile with pretended coldness
Among guests she gives him two words at most,
A most stupid sacrifice, poor Lensky ...
And all the works of Fontenelle,
And how has the heart within me been stricken!
And look on you with suppressed elation!...
And of Russians many whom we know,
And perhaps there was a secret fear
And plunging more deeply into madness
And shut him away in the darkest corner.
And sobbing, head upon your feet,
And the tears fall from her eyes in streams;
And they in chorus prescribe the waters.
And totally disconnected dreams,
And to your spiteful mocking laughter
And with a feverish hand he pens
And yet another thing came to part us...
Are better than all that happiness.
As but a cunning trick to lure
A stranger to all, bound to no one,
At home she receives him easily,
At others she regards him not a whit;
At times a distant bow she proffers,
Before you to suffer my crucifixion,
Behind her lips' enforced compression!
Being ill he is foolish and rashly rough,
Besides, my repellent liberty
Between the rows of printed lines
But he does not leave; he prefers to go
But he is stubborn and will not back off,
But his heartfelt anguish evidently
But if you knew, how terrible
But in order to give them some small scope
But I waste in boredom's cruel vanity
But now they tell me my work stinks,
But she ignores him utterly,
But Tatyana ignores this acting too
But that is denied me: only for you,
By your fierce eye may be construed
Crowded into his wandering brain.
Cursing his hopeless lunacy,
De Staël and Bichat and Tissot,
Do I open up my soul to you?
E sempre bene, as they say.
(For the sex is strangely petulant);
For what a bitter condemnation
From all things that to my heart were dear,
Had caught him and dragged him by the collar,
Had now grown quite beyond description.
Had pursued him through the world's noisiness,
He begins to fade consumptively.
He enters like one already dead,
He got through Gibbon and Rousseau,
He hastens to her, to his Tatyana,
He hopes, and fires up his indignation;
He pines, he withers, he flags, he falters,
He read the periodicals and journals
He read with spiritual eyes
Here is the letter, an exact transcription.
He remembers the time, not so long since,
He renounces the world and its society.
Her foolish folly or her past tenderness...
He stands on the edge of a precipice.
He started to read without much thought.
His eyes were reading but his mind
Horses? Reader, you have guessed it
I did not dare to entrust myself
I did not wish then to abandon.
I drag myself hopefully everywhere;
I fear that this my humble prayer
I foresee all: how the revelation
I know that my days are numbered already,
I must in the morning be assured
In her face only the remnants of anger shine.
In my very soul your complete perfection,
In the past having met you quite by chance,
In writing epistles, and why should he?
Is empty. He opens a door. What's this?
Is revealed within your haughty glance!
Is the torture of love's rabidness,
I submit to my fate, be it yes or no.
I then had wrenched my heart away;
I thought to myself: freedom and rest
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
My God! My God! How was I mistaken!
No, no! Each minute to have a glimpse
Not one rejecting - all were well.
Of criticism would come my way:
Of my sad secret will cause offence.
Of passionate gloomy histories,
Of seeing you each day, and of having your word...
Of you, to follow you everywhere,
Onegin devours her with his looks:
Onegin starts to pale; he suffers;
Only to listen to you, and to understand
Or a young maiden's letter's innocence.
Or from a long tale some lively nonsense,
Perhaps giving cause I'll rue hereafter.
Secret traditions, half-lost memories
Seeing in you that spark of tenderness
She does not see, she does not care;
She has no trace of flirtatiousness,
She ignores his presence, no word is spoken,
She is there. As the room he enters freely
She scarce holds back the indignation
She walks towards him, and so fiercely!
Sitting, in simple clothes, and pale,
(Society does not approve of it).
Some letter she is reading, silently,
Still no reply. He goes to a soirée,
Strayed far; dreams, wishes, melancholy,
That her husband or the world would guess
The day is precious, and the hour too,
The days which by fate are allotted me.
The die is cast, I am at your mercy,
Then locking himself in his silent study
The princess is before him and alone,
There is no reply. He composes another.
There is not a soul in the entrance hall.
There was no hope. He leaves the gathering
The sceptic Bayle he read also,
The smile of your mouth, your looks, your hair;
The strength to fight against this foe;
They are such a weary misery!
This incorrigible freak and romancer.
Threats, explanations, premonitions,
To a second and yet to a third letter
To burn ― and yet with reason's curb
To catch with my adoring eyes,
To fortify ones looks and speech,
To grow pale, and perish... Ah, that is bliss!
To his forbears by making a swift appointment;
To hold a reasonable conversation,
To it, and shrugged off the sweet romance;
To pour forth prayers, confessions, pleas,
To staunch the blood-letting in the soul;
To the next room. Further. But ahead all
To the princess, a passionate declaration.
To wish to fall and embrace your knees,
Was plunged in complete reverie.
What do I wish for? And with what aim
Whatever he does, he might be a ghost.
What then? It was the usual tale.
When cruel depression and bitterness
Where a trace of tears? .. No stain, no sign!
Where, where is compassion, where confusion?
Which tell us how we ought to think,
While her cheek upon her hand she leans.
With the deepest winter's cold and pride!
Yet so be it: no longer have I
You, and I hear your angry sneer.
